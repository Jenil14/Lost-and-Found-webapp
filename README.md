### University of California Davis: Lost and Found Website 
## Introduction
This web app is UCD's (University of California Davis) lost and found website. There is no exisiting university's lost and found location (virtually and physically). 

If the user has lost any item, then the user can log in only through their UC Davis email and get access to the database. The user can select campus buildings, or just places (like the quad) on the Google map.  After clicking on something for which Google returns a name, they can confirm that it is the location they meant. However, if the user has found an item, then the user also gets to search or enter a new found item.  They see a similar set of menus, and map, and they also have the option to upload  a picture of the item.  They can also specify what they did with the item (turned it into an office, kept it, left it where it was). 

The user can either search the exisiting database or enter the new lost item by the following categories:
1. date and time they believe they lost the item
2. kind of item, including an "other" category if nothing fits the text description 
3. location of the item
