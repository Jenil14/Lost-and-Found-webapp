Hello, thank you so much for all the help this quarter and for grading our final assignment!

Screen 4 and 7 both redirect to screen 2 once the user is done inputting their information, so they can then check to see if anyone's found anything/add the item as lost if there was nothing to be found already in the database.
This is also because going to screen 10 would give an error since you inputted the beginning date but there is no end date in this query, which is required for screen 9 and 10.
As a result it ends up outputting an error.

We implemented screen 9 and 10 as a table, so our styling looks a bit different than the example, but is still collapsible and usable.
The main differences are with the title being to the side of the information rather than above, which is because we implemented it as a cell in the same row as the more button, and ran out of time to change this. However, it still shows all the information and I think it still looks clean.
Because of this, we also changed the mobile design to look like a column, so the image is above the information, however, designs for mobile often work better when they are narrow like columns, so I think it still completes its functionality and intention.
Lastly, because of our table implementation, we couldn't change the 'MORE' button to 'LESS,' because we appended the hidden elements (category, description, etc), so when trying to change that it changes all of that information.
We would fix this if we had more time, but you can still open/close the tabs by pressing on them, it just doesn't say 'less.'



One of our group members, Jenil, is currently in India and had some internet issues because of a typhoon that hit his town, but we tried to complete the project to the best of our ability.
